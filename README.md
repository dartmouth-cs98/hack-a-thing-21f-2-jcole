# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

I built an app centered around `<GoogleMaps>`, with functionlity to pin a location with a marker, search and pan to a new location anywhere in the world, return to your current location, and open a marker to find more information about that pin. Since I may include location services in my senior design project, I wanted to follow and experiment with a tutorial that could teach me just that. I mainly used features provided in `@react-google-maps/api`, including useful items and hooks.

## Who Did What?

N/A, I worked alone

## What you learned

I learned a lot about both how to utilize location into a react application, but also how google syntax looks on API calls and also how to better troubleshoot errors when working with Google Cloud. The service can be pretty finnicky, so learning how to properly navigate the cloud dashboard and enable/restrict the correctv API keys was tough at first, but I eventually figured it out. Working with location services has a huge learning curve, and I am happy to have worked with it now so I can be more useful if I elect to use these servuces ub my final project. Another issue I ran into was using `async` and `await` with this webpack configuration, which I had to slightly adapt to make it work.     
<br/>
Overall, I am happy with how the application works and the functionality I was able to implement. I believe this is a good product from Google, and hope to get more experience using these services going forward (at least until my free trial period ends)
